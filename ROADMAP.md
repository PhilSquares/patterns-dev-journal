# 📅 30-Day Patterns.dev Learning Plan

- This roadmap outlines the 30 topics I’ll be exploring in my **Patterns.dev Challenge**.  
- The plan is divided into **three stages**: Rendering, Performance, and Design Patterns.

## 📖 How This Roadmap Works
- Each **day** has its own folder (`/day-X`) with:
  - A `README.md` explaining the concept.  
  - Example code snippets.  
  - Notes and personal reflections.  
- This file acts as the **master tracker** of progress.
