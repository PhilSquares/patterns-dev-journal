# 📅 30-Day Patterns.dev Learning Plan

- This roadmap outlines the 30 topics I’ll be exploring in my **Patterns.dev Challenge**.  
- The plan is divided into **three stages**: Rendering, Performance, and Design Patterns.

## ✅ Progress Tracker

### 🎨 Days 1–10: Rendering Patterns  
**Understand how applications deliver and render UI content.**  

- [x] **Day 1:** Client-Side Rendering (CSR)  
- [x] **Day 2:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR)  
- [x] **Day 3:** Static Rendering (SSG)  
- [x] **Day 4:** Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)  
- [x] **Day 5:** Streaming SSR  
- [ ] **Day 6:** Progressive Hydration  
- [ ] **Day 7:** Selective Hydration  
- [ ] **Day 8:** Islands Architecture  
- [ ] **Day 9:** Partial Hydration  
- [ ] **Day 10:** Resumability (Qwik concepts)

### ⚡️ Days 11–20: Performance Patterns  
**Focus on making apps load faster and run smoother.**  

- [ ] **Day 11:** Code Splitting  
- [ ] **Day 12:** Tree Shaking

### 🏗️ Days 21–30: Design Patterns  
**Organizing code for flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.** 

- [ ] **Day 21:** Singleton Pattern  
- [ ] **Day 22:** Factory Pattern  
- [ ] **Day 23:** Module Pattern  
- [ ] **Day 24:** Observer Pattern  
- [ ] **Day 25:** Mediator Pattern  
- [ ] **Day 26:** Strategy Pattern  
- [ ] **Day 27:** Proxy Pattern  
- [ ] **Day 28:** Adapter Pattern  
- [ ] **Day 29:** Decorator Pattern  
- [ ] **Day 30:** MVC / MVVM in modern frameworks

## 📖 How This Roadmap Works
- Each **day** has its own folder (`/day-X`) with:
  - A `README.md` explaining the concept.  
  - Example code snippets.  
  - Notes and personal reflections.  
- This file acts as the **master tracker** of progress.
