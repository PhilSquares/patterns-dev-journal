# Day 15 â€“ Import On Interaction / Visibility (Lazy Loading)

## ðŸ“„ Summary
Lazy loading with Import On Interaction or Import On Visibility delays loading JavaScript modules until the user either **interacts** with a feature (e.g., clicking a button) or the feature becomes **visible** in the viewport. This reduces the amount of code loaded upfront, improving initial load performance.

## ðŸ’¡ Problem It Solves
Large bundles increase load time, parse time, and block the main thread. Many features are not used immediatelyâ€”or at allâ€”by every user. By deferring the loading of these modules, we make apps faster and lighter for everyone.

## ðŸŒŽ Real-world Mapping
- **YouTube embeds** often load only when a user scrolls them into view.  
- **Modals or chat widgets** typically load their heavy code only when a user clicks the button to open them.  

This saves bandwidth and improves *time-to-interactive* for users who never engage with those features.

## ðŸ›  My Mini Implementation
```javascript
// Import On Interaction Example
const button = document.getElementById('open-modal');

button.addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const modalModule = await import('./modal.js');
  modalModule.openModal();
});

// Import On Visibility Example
const carousel = document.getElementById('image-carousel');

const observer = new IntersectionObserver(async (entries) => {
  if (entries[0].isIntersecting) {
    const carouselModule = await import('./carousel.js');
    carouselModule.initCarousel();
    observer.disconnect();
  }
});

observer.observe(carousel);
```
